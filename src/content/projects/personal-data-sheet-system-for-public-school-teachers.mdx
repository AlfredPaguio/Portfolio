This project was created as a part of the School Division Office (Muntinlupa) project. Our primary goal was to create software that could efficiently manage and process personal data for teachers within the public school system. However, I am currently unaware of the status or utilization of this system within the organization.

## Responsibilities:

* Assisted [Nite Guerrero](https://www.facebook.com/nite.guerrero) in the development of the system, contributing to software code creation and feature enhancement.

* Played a significant role in identifying and addressing bugs through thorough code analysis and systematic testing, ensuring the software's stability and reliability.

* Demonstrated strong problem-solving skills by implementing solutions that enhanced existing software features, contributing to the project's overall progress.
