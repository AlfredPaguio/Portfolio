**A Thesis Presented to the Faculty of the College of Information Technology and Computer Studies**\
Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Muntinlupa

* **Role in Development**: Played a key role in building a Python-based web application using Flask, aimed at comparing products from Shopee and Lazada on a unified interface. The platform aggregates product information based on user input, simplifying the evaluation process for consumers.

* **Web Scraping Implementation**: Assisted in the implementation of an efficient web scraper using **headless Selenium** and **Beautiful Soup** to retrieve real-time product details and customer reviews from Shopee and Lazada. This enriched the applicationâ€™s comparison features, offering users comprehensive insights into product quality and ratings.

* **Deployment and User Experience**: Contributed to the successful deployment of the web application on **Heroku**, demonstrating expertise in cloud-based deployment. The solution provides a user-friendly platform for cross-platform product evaluation, making online shopping decisions more informed and streamlined.
