# Hello there! ( ^\_^)／

Nice to meet you, my name is Alfred U. Paguio.

I'm always observing or investigating the minute details of objects everywhere, though I don't often share this with others.

My fascination with computers began in childhood, spending hours in internet cafes and discovering just how much they can do. By age 8, I had built my first internet café timer in VB 6. Since then, I haven’t stopped exploring the world of technology.

Not long after, I stumbled upon more areas of programming while playing custom games on Garena LAN. I created my own map in Warcraft 3 using the World Editor, with help from [Hive Workshop's resources](https://www.hiveworkshop.com/).

I also began exploring the mechanics of online interactions by experimenting with custom requests to manipulate game server responses. For this, I used tools like Fiddler and Charles Proxy, both of which act as intermediaries for monitoring and modifying web traffic. Through these tools, I gained insight into debugging and customizing web interactions, fueling my curiosity for further programming exploration.

In my free time, I’m always learning by programming and creating useful projects for my needs. I enjoy reading manga, watching anime, or playing games.

Currently, I am developing a [Project Management App](https://github.com/AlfredPaguio/Project-Management-App), which helps organize projects efficiently. This app is built using React, Inertia.js, Laravel 11, and TypeScript.
