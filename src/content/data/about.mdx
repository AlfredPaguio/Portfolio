# Hello there! ( ^\_^)Ôºè

Nice to meet you, my name is Alfred U. Paguio.

I'm always observing or investigating the minute details of objects everywhere, though I don't often share this with others.

I've been fascinated with computer-related stuff since my childhood, spending hours at an internet cafe (10 pesos per hour) funded by my family. I realized computers are really fascinating and can do a lot of cool stuff. I created my own map in Warcraft 3 using the World Editor with the help of [Hive Workshop's resources](https://www.hiveworkshop.com/) and even experimented with cheating in games using tools like Fiddler, Charles Proxy, and Warcraft 3 map hacks. Since then, I've never stopped exploring the world of technology.

Some time after, while playing custom games on Garena LAN games (Asia server), I discovered programming. I was 8 years old when I wrote my very first internet cafe timer using VB6, specifically the Visual Basic Portable program, since the computer and internet couldn't handle downloading the entire Visual Basic software at that time. Since July 2023, I have been applying for entry-level jobs in the tech field.

In my free time, I always strive to improve my knowledge by programming and creating useful projects for my needs. When I have money to go to the internet cafe (as I don't have a PC or laptop), I work on creating useful projects. I enjoy reading manga or books, watching anime, or playing games. Currently, I am developing a !\[GitHub Icon]\(https\://github.githubassets.com/images/modules/logos\_page/GitHub-Mark.png) [Project Management App](https://github.com/AlfredPaguio/Project-Management-App), which helps organize projects efficiently. This app is built using React, Inertia.js, Laravel 11, and TypeScript.
