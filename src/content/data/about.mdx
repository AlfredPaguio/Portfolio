# Hello there! ( ^\_^)／

I’m Alfred, a passionate software developer, I love problem-solving and creating applications that make a real difference. I’ve been on a continuous learning path, eagerly expanding my knowledge and honing my skills.

Currently, my focus is on mastering Next.js, React and Typescript, two powerful tools in modern web development. I believe that these technologies, combined with my enthusiasm and dedication, will enable me to build efficient, scalable, and user-friendly applications.

As a fresh graduate, I’m excited about the endless possibilities that lie ahead in the software development field. I’m eager to take on new  challenges, learn from them, and contribute my unique perspective to the tech community. I look forward to collaborating with other passionate developers and creating innovative solutions that can transform the digital landscape.

In my spare time, you’ll find me exploring the latest tech trends or delving into a new programming language or framework. I firmly believe that there’s always something new to learn in this ever-evolving field, and I’m committed to being a lifelong learner.
