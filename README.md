# Alfred's Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio! This project showcases my skills and projects, built using TypeScript, React, and various other libraries and tools. Check out the live site [here](https://alfredpaguio.vercel.app/).

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
